# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Flash! We welcome contributions from the community. To ensure a smooth process for everyone, please follow these guidelines when contributing.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the main project.

- Navigate to the [Flash repository](https://github.com/quix-labs/flash).
- Click on the **Fork** button at the top right of the page to create a copy in your own GitHub account.

### 2. Create a New Branch

Once you've forked the repository, create a new branch for the changes you want to make. It's important to keep your changes isolated in a separate branch.

You can create a branch from the command line like this:

`git checkout -b my-feature-branch`

Make sure to give your branch a descriptive name related to the feature or bugfix you're working on.

### 3. Make Your Changes

Edit, refactor, or improve the code as needed. Be sure to follow the project's coding style and best practices.

- If you're adding a new feature, consider writing tests to cover your changes.
- If you're fixing a bug, ensure that your fix solves the issue without introducing new problems.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Once you've made your changes, commit them with a clear, concise commit message that describes what you've done. Use conventional commit messages to keep the history clean and understandable.

For example:

`git commit -m "Add feature to listen for specific columns"`

### 5. Push Your Branch

After committing your changes, push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

`git push origin my-feature-branch`

### 6. Open a Pull Request

Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository, open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main repository.

- Go to the original repository (not your fork) on GitHub.
- Click on the **New Pull Request** button.
- Select your feature branch and the `main` branch of the repository as the base.
- Provide a detailed description of what your PR does and any context or explanations for your changes.

### 7. Review and Feedback

Once your PR is submitted, the maintainers will review it. They may request changes or provide feedback. Be open to feedback and make the necessary adjustments.

### 8. Merging

After your PR has been reviewed and approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main repository.
